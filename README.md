# Next.js 15 App Router Link Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Next.js 15 App Router's Link component when used within dynamic route segments.  The issue involves unexpected behavior where navigation doesn't work as expected.  The bug and its solution are provided in this repository.

## Bug Description

The `Link` component in Next.js 15 App Router may exhibit unexpected behavior when attempting to navigate to other pages within a dynamic route.  The navigation may fail or redirect to an unintended location, particularly when interacting with nested routes or deeply nested segments.

## Solution

The solution involves careful consideration of the route structure and the use of relative paths within the `href` property of the `Link` component to ensure correct navigation.  The correct usage for navigating within dynamic routes often involves explicitly specifying relative paths rather than relying on absolute paths.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the unexpected behavior when attempting to navigate using the links.

## Troubleshooting

Ensure you are using the latest version of Next.js 15 and have followed the official Next.js documentation for using the App Router.
